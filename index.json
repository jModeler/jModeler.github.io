This post will be one in a series that describes each of the aforementioned properties and provides simple proofs/examples of the same.\nAs the title suggests, we start with the Gamma distribution. We use the shape and rate parameterization of the distribution (as explained here). Without loss of generality in this case, we also set the rate parameter $ = 1$ for all random variables unless otherwise mentioned. We want to prove the additive property of the gamma distribution:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\alpha_i, 1) \\nonumber \\\\ Where \\, X_i \\sim Gamma(\\alpha_i, 1), \\, \\, i \\in \\{1,2, \\dots, N\\} \\tag{1} \\end{align}\\] Where \\[\\begin{align} Gamma(\\alpha_i, 1) = f_{X_i}(x; \\alpha_i) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_i)} x^{(\\alpha_i -1)} e^{-x} \\tag{2} \\end{align}\\] Importantly, the \\(X_i\\)’s are independent. We prove the identity by induction. For \\(N = 1\\), the property in (1) holds trivially. For \\(N=2\\), we set about deriving this from first principles. Let \\(Y = X_1 + X_2\\). We try to get the distribution of \\(Y\\). The following holds for \\(Y\\):\n\\[\\begin{align} P(Y \\le y) \u0026amp; = P(X_1 + X_2 \\le y) \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies P(Y \\le y) \u0026amp; = P(X_1 \\le y - X_2) \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies P(Y \\le y) \u0026amp; = P(X_1 \\le y - X_2 | X_2)P(X_2) \\tag{3} \\end{align}\\] The expression in (3) is a double integral, one to vary \\(X_2\\) over the range of values it can possibly take: \\((0, \\infty)\\), and the other to vary \\(X_1\\) from \\((0, y-X_2)\\). This integral takes the form below:\n\\[\\begin{align} P(Y \\le y) \u0026amp; = P(X_1 \\le y - X_2 | X_2)P(X_2) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{0}^{y-x_2} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} x_{1}^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} e^{-x_1} dX_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} x_{2}^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-x_2} dX_2 \\tag{4} \\end{align}\\] Note also, that the density of \\(Y\\) is given by: \\[\\begin{align} f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{dP(Y \\le y)}{dy} \\tag{5} \\end{align}\\] Applying the identity in (5) to the integral in (4) and using the Leibniz integral rule, we get the following:\n\\[\\begin{align} f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{d}{dy} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{0}^{y-x_2} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} x_{1}^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} e^{-x_1} dX_1 \\right) \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} x_{2}^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-x_2} dX_2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} (y-x_2)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} e^{-(y-x_2)} \\right) \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} x_{2}^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-x_2} dX_2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} (y-x_2)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} x_{2}^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} dX_2 \\tag{6} \\end{align}\\] We now attempt to convert the integral in (6) into a form that is well known. We set \\(Z = \\frac{X_2}{y}\\), which gives us \\(dX_2 = ydZ\\), and also note that \\(Z\\) can take the range of values bounded by the interval \\((0,1)\\) (\\(Z \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(X_2 \\rightarrow 0\\) and \\(Z \\rightarrow 1\\) as \\(X_2 \\rightarrow \\infty\\), since \\(Y \\rightarrow \\infty\\) too). Replacing \\(X_2\\) with \\(Z\\) in (6), we get:\n\\[\\begin{align} f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} (y- yz)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} (yz)^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} ydZ \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} y^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} ydZ \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\int_{0}^{1} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ \\tag{7} \\end{align}\\] The integral in (7) is the Beta function, whose value is given below:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\int_{0}^{1} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)} \\tag{8} \\end{align}\\] Substituting (8) back into (7), we get: \\[\\begin{align} f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)}\\nonumber \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\tag{9} \\\\ \\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2, 1) \\nonumber \\end{align}\\] From (9), we have now proved that the property in (1) holds for \\(N=2\\). We now assume this is true for \\(N\\) and show that this property holds for \\(N+1\\). Now, let \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\), which gives us the following identities:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; = Y + X_{N+1} \\tag{10} \\\\ Y \u0026amp; \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i,1) \\tag{11} \\end{align}\\] (11) follows from the induction assumption. Since the property in (1) is true for \\(N=2\\), we combine this with the identities in (10) \u0026amp; (11) to get:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; = Y + X_{N+1} \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i + \\alpha_{N+1},1) \\nonumber \\\\ \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} \\alpha_i,1) \\tag{12} \\end{align}\\] (12) shows that the property in (1) is true for \\(N+1\\), completing the proof.\nReferences Antoniak, Charles E. 1974. “Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes with Applications to Bayesian Nonparametric Problems.” The Annals of Statistics.

While approximating integrals with MC methods are simpler to implement, they might lead to integral values with considerable simulation error (Skrainka and Judd 2011). This post attempts to demonstrate the claim in Skrainka and Judd (2011) using two very simple integrals, to which we already know the value.

We now use the nodes and weights generated from this package to approximate the first integral. I re-use some of the code provided in the documentation for the SparseGrid package in R.\nlibrary(SparseGrid) #generate sparse grids for a 5 dimensional RV with accuracy level 2 sg \u0026lt;- createSparseGrid(type=\u0026#39;KPN\u0026#39;, dimension=5, k=2) sg_int \u0026lt;- function(func, sg, ...) { gx \u0026lt;- apply(sg$nodes, 1, function(x) {func(x, ...)}) return(sum(gx * sg$weights)) } sg_val \u0026lt;- sg_int(s, sg) sg_val ## [1] 0 The result here is exactly 0. In light of this finding, the value obtained from the MC approach, in comparison, is a little off, and tends to show a high variance in output:\nset.seed(100) mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.007150433 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.03162326 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] -0.1287932 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.01040134 mc_int(s, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] -0.03798655 In the third case, there is a \\(-12\\%\\) error(!) in the value of the computed integral when compared to the result from the SG approach. The SG approach, in addition, shows no such variation in repeated runs, since the grid values and weights are fixed for a given accuracy level and dimension (of the variable being integrated).\nI repeat the calculations for the second integral, as shown below\nMC approach:\nset.seed(100) n \u0026lt;- 1000 mc_val \u0026lt;- mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) mc_val ## [1] 1.001089 SG approach:\n#generate sparse grids for a 5 dimensional RV with accuracy level 6 sg \u0026lt;- createSparseGrid(type=\u0026#39;KPN\u0026#39;, dimension=5, k=6) sg_val \u0026lt;- sg_int(p, sg) sg_val ## [1] 1 Once again, the SG approach gives us an exact value (note that the value of \\(k\\), the accuracy level, has gone up, since the integrand is a higher order function). Again, the difference of the results between the two approaches doesn’t seem that large. However, variability of the results from the MC approach is still a concern, as shown below:\nset.seed(100) mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 1.001089 mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.4672555 mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 1.14692 mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 1.062975 mc_int(p, n, mu = rep(0,5), sigma = diag(5)) ## [1] 0.9112416 In the second case, there is a roughly \\(53\\%\\) (!!) error when compared to the true value of the integral. This variability could be worse with more complicated integrands.\nOne suggestion to reduce variability in MC methods is to increase the number of draws, but that would entail a lot of calculations and result in longer runtimes.\nReferences Genz, Alan, Frank Bretz, Tetsuhisa Miwa, Xuefei Mi, Friedrich Leisch, Fabian Scheipl, and Torsten Hothorn. 2019. mvtnorm: Multivariate Normal and T Distributions. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mvtnorm.\n Heiss, Florian, and Viktor Winschel. 2008. “Likelihood Approximation by Numerical Integration on Sparse Grids.” Journal of Econometrics 144 (1).
