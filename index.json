At a very abstract level, given a system of equations for which a solution is needed, we convert this system to one whose solution we already know (or is easy to find out), and then bend this system till we get the solution to the original set of equations. These methods have very broad applications (Garcia and Zangwill 1981), and have been applied in the context of finding equlibria in Static Games (Bajari et al. 2010) and Dynamic Games (Borkovsky, Doraszelski, and Kryukov 2010).\nExample 1: Linear System\rSay we want to find the solution to the following system of linear equations:\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\left[ \\begin{array}\r{rrrrr}\r1 \u0026amp; 2 \\\\\r3 \u0026amp; 4 \\\\\r\\end{array}\\right] \\left[ \\begin{array} {r} x_1 \\\\\rx_2 \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 5 \\\\\r11 \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] \\tag{1} \\end{align}\\]\nReaders should very easily be able to verify that the unique solution to this system is\r\\[\r(x_1,x_2) = (1,2)\r\\]\nLet’s convert this system and introduce an additional parameter \\(t\\), called the homotopy parameter, which varies from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Let’s call this new system \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\)\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\left[ \\begin{array}\r{rr}\r1 \u0026amp; 2 \\\\\r3 \u0026amp; 4 \\\\\r\\end{array}\\right] \\left[ \\begin{array} {r} x_1 \\\\\rx_2 \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 5t \\\\\r11t \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] \\tag{2} \\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(t=0\\), \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\) yields the trivial (and only) solution \\((x_1,x_2) = (0,0)\\). When \\(t=1\\), we get our original system of equations back. When we solve for \\((x_1, x_2)\\) as a function of \\(t\\), we get:\r\\[\r(x_1(t),x_2(t)) = (t,2t)\r\\]\rAt \\(t=1\\), this will give us the solution we desire. Tracing the path of the solution gives us the following plots:\rFrom this very simple example, we note that the general process followed is given below (Garcia and Zangwill 1981):\nConvert the system of equations into one that has a known solution (i.e. \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\) case above)\rIntroduce a new parameter \\(t\\), that gives the known system at \\(t=0\\) and the system for which the solutions are desired when \\(t=1\\)\rTrace the path of the solutions by changing the value of \\(t\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\)\r\r\rExample 2: Nonlinear System\rConsider the following system of equations (from chapter 1, exercise 6 of (Garcia and Zangwill 1981)):\r\\[\\begin{align}\rF(x_1, x_2) = \\left[ \\begin{array}\r{l}\re^{2 x_1} - x^{2}_{2} + 3 \\\\\r4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} - x^{3}_{2} \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right]\r= \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 0 \\\\\r0 \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] \\tag{3} \\\\\r(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\\rF: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\r\\end{align}\\]\nAgain, readers should verify that the solutions to this system of equations are \\((x1, x2) = (0, -2) \\, \\\u0026amp; \\, (x1, x2) = (0, 2)\\).\nWe now introduce the homotopy parameter \\(t\\), and define \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\rH(x_1, x_2, t) = F(x_1, x_2) - (1-t)F(0, 0) \\tag{4}\r\\end{align}\\]\nThe formulation in (4) is called the Newton Homotopy (Garcia and Zangwill 1981). A distinct advantage of this formulation, is that at \\(t=0\\), it is easy to see that the solution to the system is \\((0, 0)\\).\nFor any \\(t\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) becomes:\r\\[\\begin{align}\r\\left[ \\begin{array}\r{l}\re^{2 x_1} - x^{2}_{2} + 4t - 1 \\\\\r4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} - x^{3}_{2} \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right]\r= \\left[ \\begin{array} {l} 0 \\\\\r0 \\\\\r\\end{array} \\right] \\tag{5}\r\\end{align}\\]\nWe now attempt to find \\((x_1, x_2)\\) as functions of \\(t\\). From (5), we have:\r\\[\\begin{align}\rx_{2}^{3} = 4x_{2}e^{2 x_1} \\nonumber \\\\\rx_2 = 0 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, OR \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, x_{2} = \\pm 2e^{x_1} \\tag{6}\r\\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(x_2 = 0\\), putting this back in (5) we get:\r\\[\\begin{align}\re^{2 x_1} + 4t - 1 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} log(1-4t) \\tag{7} \\\\\rwhere \\,\\,\\,\\, 0 \\le t \\le 1/4\r\\end{align}\\]\nWhen \\(x_2 = \\pm 2e^{x_1}\\), putting this back in (5) we get:\r\\[\\begin{align}\r-3e^{2 x_1} + 4t - 1 = 0 \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} log\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right) \\tag{8} \\\\\rwhere \\,\\,\\,\\, 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\le 1\r\\end{align}\\]\nCombining all the findings from (6), (7) and (8), we get:\r\\[\\begin{align}\rx_1(t) = \\begin{cases}\r\\frac{1}{2} log(1-4t) \u0026amp; \\text{for } 0\\le t \\le 1/4\\\\\r\\frac{1}{2} log\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right) \u0026amp; \\text{for } 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\leq 1\r\\end{cases} \\tag{9} \\\\\rx_1(t) = \\begin{cases}\r0 \u0026amp; \\text{for } 0\\le t \\le 1/4\\\\\r\\pm 2 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4t-1}{3}\\right)} \u0026amp; \\text{for } 1/4 \u0026lt; t \\leq 1\r\\end{cases} \\tag{10}\r\\end{align}\\]\nWhich gives us the solution to the system of equations in (3) at \\(t = 1\\). However, note that the functions \\(x_1(t), x_2(t)\\) are non-differentiable, which disqualifies them from being solution paths (Garcia and Zangwill 1981). This is evident in the plots shown below:\rOne could always try another formulation for \\(H(x_1, x_2, t)\\) which leads to well defined paths to the desired solution from the known solution (i.e. the solution to \\(H(x_1, x_2, 0)\\)).

We now have to prove this for any general \\(N\\). Now, let \\(Z = \\sum_{i=2}^{N} X_i\\) and \\(Y = \\frac{X_1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i}\\), which gives us the following identities:\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i \u0026amp; = X_{1} + Z \\tag{11} \\\\\r\\implies Y \u0026amp; = \\frac{X_1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i} = \\frac{X_1}{X_1 + Z} \\tag{12} \\\\\rZ \u0026amp; \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=2}^{N} \\alpha_i,1) \\tag{13}\r\\end{align}\\]\nWhere the result in (13) was proved in the previous post.

Replacing \\(X_2\\) with \\(Z\\) in (8), we get:\n\\[\\begin{align}\rf_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} (y- yz)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} (yz)^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} ydZ \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} y^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} ydZ \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\int_{0}^{1} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ \\tag{9} \\end{align}\\]\nThe integral in (9) is the Beta function, whose value is given below:\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\\int_{0}^{1} (1- z)^{(\\alpha_1 -1)} z^{(\\alpha_2 -1)} dZ = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)} \\tag{10}\r\\end{align}\\]\nSubstituting (10) back into (9), we get:\r\\[\\begin{align}\rf_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1)\\Gamma(\\alpha_2)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)}\\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)} y^{(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 -1)} e^{-y} \\tag{11} \\\\\r\\implies f_{Y}(y) \u0026amp; = Gamma(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2, 1) \\nonumber\r\\end{align}\\]\nFrom (11), we have now proved that the property in (1) holds for \\(N=2\\). We now assume this is true for \\(N\\) and show that this property holds for \\(N+1\\). Now, let \\(Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\), which gives us the following identities:\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; = Y + X_{N+1} \\tag{12} \\\\\rY \u0026amp; \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i,1) \\tag{13}\r\\end{align}\\]\n(13) follows from the induction assumption. Since the property in (1) is true for \\(N=2\\), we combine this with the identities in (12) \u0026amp; (13) to get:\n\\[\\begin{align}\r\\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; = Y + X_{N+1} \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i + \\alpha_{N+1},1) \\nonumber \\\\\r\\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} X_i \u0026amp; \\sim Gamma(\\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} \\alpha_i,1) \\tag{14} \\end{align}\\]\n(14) shows that the property in (1) is true for \\(N+1\\), completing the proof.\nReferences\rAntoniak, Charles E. 1974. “Mixtures of Dirichlet Processes with Applications to Bayesian Nonparametric Problems.” The Annals of Statistics, 1152–74.\n\rFerguson, Thomas S. 1973. “A Bayesian Analysis of Some Nonparametric Problems.” The Annals of Statistics, 209–30.\n\r\r\r","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567558547,"objectID":"f0081b01add0652d81ba1d39b4bb0b10","permalink":"/post/additive-property-of-the-gamma-distribution/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/additive-property-of-the-gamma-distribution/","section":"post","summary":"While learning Bayesian Nonparametric methodology, I found a few properties useful in understanding the way Dirichlet Process Priors worked (this is a prior used very commonly in the field (Ferguson (1973), Antoniak (1974))) .
